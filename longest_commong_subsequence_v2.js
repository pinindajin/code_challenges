/**
 * PROBLEM:
 * 
 * When Alex is preparing for his next climb and has decided that the 
 * best way to prepare is to write down two different unique sequences
 * of moves he can do to complete his route. Alex gives each individual 
 * move within a given unique sequence a code name. 
 * 
 * An example of a unique sequence of moves could be represented as an array of 
 * strings such as the following: ["Sambal", "Olec", "Pretty", "Bird", "Hunger", "Olec"]
 *
 * Note that moves can be repeated.
 * 
 * After having written down two separate unique sequences,
 * Alex then finds the longest common subsequence among
 * the two unique sequences so that he can put extra practice
 * into those moves.
 * 
 * Alex loves climbing, but does not really like having to do logic puzzles.
 * Fortunately you are a friend of Alex and have agreed to write some code
 * to figure out the longest common subsequence among two unique sequences
 * for him.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE CASES
 * 
 * ['Dog', 'Yam', 'Dog', 'Tattoo', 'Ginger', 'Shoe']
 * ['Yam', 'Dog', 'Shoe', 'Yam', 'Dog', 'Ginger']
 * => 
 * ['Dog', 'Yam', 'Dog', 'Ginger']
 * 
 * 
 * ['Dog', 'Ludacious', 'Ludacious', 'Anakin', 'Dog', 'Yam']
 * ['Ludacious', 'Spyro', 'Anakin', 'Spyro', 'Dog', 'Plum', 'Yam'] 
 * =>
 * ['Ludacious', 'Anakin', 'Dog', 'Yam']
 * 
 * 
 * ['Dog', 'Dog', 'Dog', 'Dog']
 * ['Dog', 'Dog']
 * =>
 * ['Dog', 'Dog']
 * 
 * 
 * ['Tea', 'Tea', 'Tea']
 * []
 * => 
 * []
 * 
 * 
 * ['Dog', 'Yam', 'Yam', 'Dog']
 * ['Dog', 'Yam', 'Trout', 'Dog', 'Yam', 'Dog'] 
 * => 
 * ['Dog', 'Yam', 'Yam', 'Dog']
